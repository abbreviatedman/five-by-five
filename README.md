# Five By Five

### Introduction

Do you have _opinions_. Sure you do! Let's talk about them by making lists of the top 5 [somethings]. Top 5 NBA Players? Top 5 Cretaceous Dinosaurs? Top 5 My Little Pony Characters? Up to you!


### Content

We're going to make not one, not two, but FIVE Top 5 lists. Twenty-five items in total!

![Faith from Buffy saying "We're five by five".](https://media.tenor.co/images/2988114c5b0435f77ab31f11833562e8/raw)

What is IN those lists is up to you--but please, make it SFW.

### Presentation

Every list should be a `<ul>` with five `<li>`s. Each of those items should _itself_ be a link. Each of _those_ links should lead to an image. Don't forget: you can get an image from THE INTERNET for BASICALLY ANYTHING EVER. Grab that url and `href` it!

Stretch Goals 

* Move the images locally! You can save them from the browser to your Downloads folder, then `mv` them to a directory in your project. What directory? The common thing is to name it "assets", but you can call it "images" or whatever you want. You'll have to change your `a` tags' `href` attributes, for sure!
* Take a list and give three reasons for each item in it. Make those three reasons their own sub-sub-sub-list. An example (if _each_ player below had three reasons given!):

    >>Top 5 Red Sox Players
    >>
    >>* J.D. Martinez
    >>    * Unquestionably the best hitter on the team.
    >>    * Hits so well that his lack of defensive contribution only brings >>him back to other top players' level.
    >>    * Playing for free agency, so likely to overperform.
    >>* Chris Sale
    >>    * Best Red Sox Lefty since... Jon Lester? Or... CY YOUNG?!
    >>    * Striking people out at a record pace, even better than his pre-Sox >>days.
    >>    * The guy you count on to take the mound when it's Big Game time.
    >>* Michael Chavis
    >>    * Might not actually be best, but as the newest regular position >>player, certainly one of the most interesting!
    >>    * Got off to quite a good start this season.
    >>    * Seems like the kind of player who will be able to make adjustments >>to the pitchers as they figure him out.
    >>* Xander Boegarts
    >>    * Fun to watch as a well-rounded player who can perform defensively >>and offensively.
    >>    * Signed an extension to be a Red Sox player for life, which takes >>commitment and faith.
    >>    * While he doesn't hit as well as was expected originally, is a far >>better defender, quelling any talk of moving him to third.
    >>* Mookie Betts
    >>    * M.
    >>    * V.
    >>    * P.
    
* Put each list in its own html page, and transform the main page into a simple list of links to those pages. `<a href = "other-page.html">` will make that happen!
* Add an image to your main page for each Top 5 list you're linking too.
* Move your local images into sub-directories according to what list they belong to. Make sure each link still works!
